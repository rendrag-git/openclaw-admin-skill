# OpenClaw Update Failure Patterns

Use this file after the main `SKILL.md` install/update workflow narrows a problem to update drift, plugin drift, service-manager disagreement, task ledger health, or post-update channel/runtime regressions.

These are symptom-matching patterns, not a command script. Keep the scope narrow, avoid destructive cleanup until the loaded paths and service owner are known, and verify after every repair.

Source note: this reference is adapted from the MIT-licensed `BKF-Gitty/openclaw-update-runbook` project and generalized for any OpenClaw install shape.

## 1. Update Channel Drift

Symptom:
- The host intentionally runs beta/dev or a newer stable build.
- `status --deep` says the local version is newer than the published "latest" version.
- Config metadata still shows a different update channel than the package that was installed.

Inspect:
- `openclaw --version`
- `openclaw status --deep`
- `openclaw config get update`

Why it matters:
- Update advice can be misleading when installed version and recorded channel disagree.
- Record the real version/channel before deciding whether to update, downgrade, or leave the host alone.

## 2. Stale Config After Upgrade

Symptom:
- `doctor` warns that a provider, plugin, model alias, or config key is unknown.
- Runtime falls back to auto-detect or legacy behavior.
- A helper command appears to fix the issue, but the warning remains.

Inspect:
- `openclaw doctor --non-interactive --no-workspace-suggestions`
- `openclaw config validate`
- Specific config keys named in the warning, often `tools.web.search.provider`, `plugins.allow`, `plugins.entries.*`, model aliases, and fallback chains.

Recovery:
- Remove or update only the stale key after backing up config.
- Re-run validation and doctor before restarting.

## 3. Bundled Plugin Shadowed By External Plugin

Symptom:
- A capability should be bundled with the host package, but the gateway loads an older global/npm/plugin-path copy.
- `plugins list` or `plugins inspect` shows a source path outside the host package.
- The loaded plugin version does not match the host package cohort.

Inspect:
- `openclaw plugins inspect <id>`
- `openclaw plugins list --json`
- The plugin source/origin/version fields and whether the source has compiled runtime output such as `dist/`.

Recovery:
- Decide which install should be canonical.
- Prefer reconciling the external install or install record over deleting directories blindly.
- Restart only after the loaded path and intended source are clear.

## 4. Plugin Install Records Drift From Disk

Symptom:
- Config or plugin registry says a plugin exists, but the recorded path is missing.
- Plugin warnings mention phantom installs or allowlist entries.
- `plugins doctor` points to a package path that is not on disk.

Inspect:
- `~/.openclaw/plugins/installs.json` or the equivalent profile-specific plugin install registry.
- `~/.openclaw/npm/node_modules/@openclaw/...`
- `~/.openclaw/extensions/...`
- `openclaw plugins registry --refresh`

Recovery:
- Refresh the registry first.
- Reinstall the single missing plugin when the install record is clearly stale.
- Avoid broad plugin reinstall until the registry and disk state are compared.

## 5. Third-Party Plugin Runtime Dependencies Removed

Symptom:
- A third-party plugin fails after update or cleanup with `Cannot find module ...`.
- The plugin root remains, but its local `node_modules` or bundled dependency directory is gone.

Inspect:
- Plugin package directory and `package.json`.
- Whether dependencies are declared as runtime dependencies, peer dependencies, optional peers, or externalized build inputs.
- Whether a cleanup command removed plugin-local runtime dependencies.

Recovery:
- Reinstall or roll back the specific third-party plugin.
- Preserve the broken directory if you need evidence for an upstream report.

## 6. Context Engine Not Registered After Restart

Symptom:
- Logs say the context engine falls back to legacy behavior.
- The plugin appears installed but is not registered or initialized.

Inspect:
- `openclaw plugins doctor`
- `openclaw plugins inspect <context-plugin-id>`
- Recent startup logs for dependency, contract, registry, or load-order errors.

Recovery:
- Fix the plugin load error first.
- Then re-run `plugins doctor` and restart if plugin loading is not hot-reloaded.

## 7. Event Loop Degradation After Update

Symptom:
- `channels status --deep` reports degraded event-loop health.
- Logs mention lane wait thresholds, active-memory timeouts, long approval followups, or restart blocked by active tasks.

Inspect:
- `openclaw tasks audit`
- Recent gateway logs and error logs.
- Plugin load retry loops and long-running task runs.

Recovery:
- Clear or repair the specific stale task/ledger issue only when it is understood.
- Re-run channel status and task audit after the repair.

## 8. Task Ledger Blocks Clean Restart

Symptom:
- Gateway drain, restart, or status reports active task runs that should no longer be active.
- `tasks audit` reports stale running tasks, lost tasks, timestamp inconsistencies, or repeated delivery failures.

Inspect:
- `openclaw tasks audit`
- `openclaw tasks show <id>`
- Recent logs around the task IDs named by audit.

Recovery:
- Cancel or run maintenance only for tasks that are clearly stale or corrupt.
- Verify with `openclaw tasks audit` before treating runtime health as clean.

## 9. Command-Path Disagreement

Symptom:
- `doctor` or `status --deep` says a token, provider, or channel is unavailable from the command path.
- The live gateway's channel health says connected and ready.

Likely cause:
- The interactive shell and the service manager do not share the same environment, config path, profile, or user home.

Inspect:
- `openclaw config file`
- `openclaw gateway status`
- Service-manager environment source, without printing secret values.
- `openclaw channels status --deep`

Recovery:
- Treat shell-only warnings as evidence to investigate, not proof that the live gateway is down.
- Align the service and shell env/config only after confirming which runtime is authoritative.

## 10. Maintainer Handoff Bundle

When an issue looks like a package or plugin regression rather than local drift, collect:

- Version before and after.
- Install type and service manager.
- Plugin source path actually loaded.
- Whether the plugin is bundled, global/npm-installed, ClawHub-installed, or local-extension-installed.
- Exact doctor/plugins doctor warning text.
- Redacted startup log lines around the failure.
- Relevant non-secret config keys.

Do not include secrets, tokens, full env files, session bodies, or agent workspace contents.

## 11. Plugin Updater Follows Stale Install Records

Symptom:
- The host package is updated, but plugin install records still pin old specs.
- `openclaw plugins update --all` reinstalls or downgrades plugins to the old recorded versions.
- Disk versions briefly move forward, then update-all reverts them.

Inspect:
- Plugin install records and their `spec` fields.
- Actual package versions under the profile's npm plugin directory.
- `openclaw plugins inspect <id>` for source/origin/version.

Recovery:
- Update the specific plugin with an explicit desired spec when supported, for example `openclaw plugins update <id> <package>@latest`.
- Use `plugins update --all` only after install records already point at the desired specs.

## 12. Control UI Token Mismatch

Symptom:
- Gateway health is good and the dashboard loads.
- Control UI websocket auth fails with token mismatch or unauthorized logs.

Inspect:
- Recent websocket auth log lines.
- Whether `gateway.auth.token` or its SecretRef source changed.
- Whether the browser-side Control UI is holding an older token.

Recovery:
- Separate browser/UI auth cache problems from server-side startup failures.
- Refresh the UI-side token only after confirming the gateway token source is correct.

## 13. Channel SecretRef Resolves In Audit But Fails At Runtime

Symptom:
- `openclaw config validate` passes.
- `openclaw secrets audit` reports no unresolved secrets.
- A channel still reports token unavailable or fails to start.

Inspect:
- The channel token config field shape, without printing the secret value.
- The referenced secrets provider and whether the live gateway can resolve it.
- Gateway startup logs for plugin-side SecretRef errors.
- Whether another plugin using the same SecretRef provider resolves successfully.

Recovery:
- Prefer fixing provider/runtime resolution.
- If a temporary inline or env fallback is unavoidable, call out the security tradeoff, get user approval, and plan to revert after the plugin/runtime bug is fixed.

## 14. Gateway CLI Start Error But Service Manager Recovers

Symptom:
- `openclaw gateway start` prints an argument or invocation error.
- Service-manager state, listener checks, or health endpoint show the gateway is actually running.

Inspect:
- Native service-manager status.
- `openclaw gateway status`
- Listening port and process owner.
- Recent stdout/stderr logs.

Recovery:
- Verify service reality before reinstalling or retrying start commands.
- Treat the CLI error as one signal, not proof of outage.

## 15. Plugin Uninstall Removes More Than The Install Directory

Symptom:
- After `openclaw plugins uninstall <id> --force`, the plugin directory is gone.
- Config entries, allowlist rows, and exclusive slot assignments may also disappear.
- Re-enabling a sibling/local copy does not restore prior slot config automatically.

Inspect:
- `plugins.entries.<id>`
- `plugins.allow`
- `plugins.slots.*`
- Plugin install records and the remaining on-disk plugin copies.

Recovery:
- Use uninstall only when you intend to remove all traces.
- If the goal is to switch loaded paths, prefer registry refresh, explicit enable/disable, or a backed-up config edit.

## 16. Optional Peer Dependency Imported Unconditionally

Symptom:
- A third-party plugin declares a peer dependency as optional, but load fails with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`.
- The compiled bundle imports the optional peer unconditionally.

Inspect:
- `package.json` `peerDependencies`, `peerDependenciesMeta`, `dependencies`, and `devDependencies`.
- Token-level import specifiers in compiled output without dumping minified bundles into the conversation.
- Whether another host only works because the dependency is hoisted elsewhere.

Recovery:
- Roll back to a known-good plugin build or wait for a fixed package.
- Avoid manually installing the missing peer into the plugin directory as a hidden local patch; future plugin updates will overwrite it.

## 17. Duplicate Plugin ID Warnings

Symptom:
- `plugins doctor` warns about duplicate plugin IDs.
- Warning text may wrap poorly and appear self-referential.
- There may be both an extensions copy and a managed npm/global copy.

Inspect:
- Every `openclaw.plugin.json` matching the plugin ID under the profile's plugin roots.
- `openclaw plugins inspect <id>` source path.
- `plugins.load.paths`.

Recovery:
- If two real manifests exist, pick the canonical one and archive the other with user approval.
- If the warning path is identical to the loaded source path and no second manifest exists, treat it as a false positive and avoid deleting the canonical install.

## 18. Bundled Provider Discovery Mode Drift

Symptom:
- After upgrade, doctor warns that a restrictive plugin allowlist is still using legacy bundled provider discovery behavior.
- A new or previously implicit config key controls whether bundled providers bypass or obey `plugins.allow`.

Inspect:
- `plugins.allow`
- `plugins.bundledDiscovery`
- Agent model primary/fallback provider prefixes.
- Whether required provider credentials are available to the service runtime.

Recovery:
- If preserving legacy behavior, explicitly pin the compatibility mode if supported.
- If strict allowlisting is desired, add required bundled provider IDs to `plugins.allow`, set allowlist mode, restart if required, and verify doctor plus model availability.

## 19. Non-Interactive Plugin Uninstall Prompt

Symptom:
- `openclaw plugins uninstall <id>` prompts for confirmation and no-ops in a non-interactive shell.
- A noisy top-level-await or prompt warning may obscure that no input was provided.

Recovery:
- Use the CLI's supported force flag when non-interactive uninstall is explicitly intended.
- Run a dry run first when available.
- Re-check `plugins list` before assuming the uninstall happened.

## 20. Multi-Step Remote Update Disconnects Mid-Run

Symptom:
- A long remote command stops returning output while the target host keeps running parts of the script.
- Reconnecting shows package updates, plugin reinstalls, or restarts partially or fully completed.

Likely cause:
- Restarting the service manager, replacing a wrapper, or changing the process tree detached the remote shell from the caller.

Inspect:
- Fresh remote process list.
- Gateway listener and health endpoint.
- Package and plugin versions on disk.
- A remote log file if the update command redirected output.

Recovery:
- Do not rerun the entire update blindly.
- Kill orphan wrapper processes only when identified and safe.
- Prefer separate phases for stop, package update, plugin reconcile, start, and verify.

## 21. Version Drift Between Operator Sessions

Symptom:
- A host has a different OpenClaw version than the last audited state, even though the current operator did not update it.
- Auto-update config appears disabled, but another scheduled process or agent updated the host.

Inspect:
- `openclaw --version`
- Cron/autopilot/scheduled jobs that can run package or plugin updates.
- Plugin disk versions.
- Recent package-manager or gateway logs.

Recovery:
- Treat every update/debug session as a fresh audit.
- Do not apply yesterday's workaround until the current state is re-snapshotted.

## 22. Cohort Version Snapshot Before Update

Practice:
- Before stopping or updating, snapshot host and plugin versions.
- After update, snapshot again and compare.

Generic commands:

```bash
openclaw --version
openclaw plugins list --json
```

If plugin package directories are available, also capture package names and versions from each `package.json` using a redacting/local-only command.

Why it matters:
- A package update can move the host but leave one plugin on the old cohort.
- The snapshot provides rollback evidence if a new plugin version has a packaging regression.

## 23. Service Environment Quote Corruption

Symptom:
- A channel starts returning upstream auth failures immediately after a host update or service-env regeneration.
- Channel status may still say the token came from env/config.
- The underlying secret source did not change.

Possible cause:
- The service environment writer wrapped a string secret with literal quote characters, so the service passes `"token"` instead of `token`.

Inspect safely:
- This requires explicit user approval because service env files can contain secrets.
- Use a local redacting check that prints only variable names and whether the value has suspicious leading/trailing quote characters. Do not print token substrings.
- Check every affected `*_TOKEN` and `*_API_KEY` line, not only one channel.

Recovery:
- Back up the service env file before editing.
- Rewrite only affected env lines from the canonical secret source without printing values.
- Restart through the appropriate service manager.
- Re-run `openclaw channels status --deep` and inspect auth logs for the affected channel.

Why it matters:
- Rotating the upstream credential is the wrong fix when the local service env value was corrupted.
- Treat any operation that regenerates service env files as a reason to re-verify channel auth.
